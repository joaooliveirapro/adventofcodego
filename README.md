# Advent of Code Go 🎄👨‍💻
This repo contains **my attempt** at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) &copy;

This was a fun project when I was bored at home. There's hardly any thought put into the solutions and some solutions are not very performant. My main goal was **getting to the solution**, sometimes using the most naive approach, without much consideration for performance or algorithm design.
