# Advent of Code Go 🎄👨‍💻
This repo contains **my attempt** at the [Advent of Code](adventofcode.com) &copy;

This was a fun project when I was bored at home. There's hardly any thought put into the solutions and some are not very performant.

My main goal was getting to the solution, sometimes using the most naive approach.
